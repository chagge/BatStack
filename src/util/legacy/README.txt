src/util/legacy

This directory should contain tools whose primary purpose is to ease
working with earlier versions of Array Project components (whether
hardware, software, etc.) and to provide simple means to
update/upgrade.  In particular, if you are new to the Project, or are
using new gear or building your own for the first time, you likely
will NOT need anything here.
