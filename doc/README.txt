BatStack documentation

This directory contains any and all major pieces of documentation
related to the Batlab Microphone Array Project (or BatStack), with the
current centerpiece being the technical manual. The LaTeX source for it is
BatStack_man.tex.

To create copies, you must first create a build directory, if one does
not already exist:

$ mkdir build

Then let the Makefile do the rest; simply enter

$ make

The result is under build/BatStack_man.pdf

Cheers!
