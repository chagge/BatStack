Only files in original editor formats, e.g. XCF (for GIMP) or Inkscape
SVG (for Inkscape), should be manipulated or branched.  Files in
exported formats, e.g. PNG or JPEG, are in such a form for use in
documentation (possibly permanent or verbatim), and should only be
edited directly in special cases.
